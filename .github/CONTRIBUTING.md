============

Issue tracker
-------------

The Issue tracker serves mainly as a place to report bugs and request new features. Please do not abuse it
as a general questions or troubleshooting location.

For that matter you can always use the
[mpdf tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mpdf) at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).


Pull requests
-------------

Pull requests should be always based on the default [development](https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf/tree/development)
branch.

Code should be accompanied by a unit test testing expected behaviour.
